# javascript and classes

Yes, JavaScript does have classes. They were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) as syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance. Classes in JavaScript provide a more familiar syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance, similar to class-based languages like Java or C++.

but still js is a prototype based language only classes are introduced just as a syntatical sugar.
