/* do while loop is just an another version of while loop isme 
pehle kaam execute hota hai then condition check hoti hai 
so here 11 will print but uske aage print nahi hoga due to 
condition. 

so this is some exceptional behaviour of do while loop from 
normal while loop but we would be using do while loop very 
very rare.*/
